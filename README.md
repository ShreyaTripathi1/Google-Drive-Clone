# Google Drive Clone

This is a Google Drive clone web application built using HTML, CSS, and Materialize CSS.
The project replicates the basic interface of Google Drive, featuring a navigation bar, a sidebar with various options, and a display section for folders.

## Features

- **Navigation Bar:** A top navigation bar that includes search functionality, quick access to notifications, and profile settings.
- **Sidebar Menu:** A sidebar with options like My Drive, Computers, Shared with Me, Recent, Google Photos, Starred, Trash, Backup, and Storage Upgrade.
- **Folder Section:** A dedicated area for displaying folders, styled as cards with icons to represent different directories.
- **Material Design Aesthetics:** The interface utilizes Materialize CSS for a clean and modern appearance. [Materialize CSS is a framework that provides ready-made classes and components that adhere to Material Design principles. It simplifies the process of creating a modern, responsive UI. Classes like `nav-extended`, `material-icons`, `grey-text`, and `text-darken-1` are all part of Materialize CSS. They provide a consistent and clean design without the need to write custom CSS for these elements.]

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For the basic structure of the web page.
- **CSS3**: For styling the elements and layout.
- **Materialize CSS**: For implementing Material Design principles, ensuring a clean and responsive UI.
- **Google Fonts & Icons**: To enhance the visual appeal of the application.
